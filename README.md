# Rainbow Spectre

![Project Cover](https://github.com/sunyatasattva/rainbow-spectre/blob/develop/public/images/social-cover.png?raw=true)

See it working at: [https://suonoterapia.org/sound-of-color]


This project is an exploration of the relationships between sounds and colors. Specifically,
it tries to explore two different avenues of connection:

1. The [Hue Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel) or the [Visible Spectrum Wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum)
as an Octave. Given that our eyes see more or less an Octave worth of light frequencies,
how would musical intervals look like if they were color pairs?

2. Transforming [pure color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color) frequencies into
audible frequencies, using *octavation*. Basically, halving the color frequency over and over
until it falls into the spectrum of audible (and even musical sounds).

Both these approaches have their theoretical problems and are best explained in the information
bar on the project itself.

## Technical details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and it is build in TypeScript.

### Contributing

If you see any mistakes in the way the two above points are explored, or if you see ways
to optimize the performance, feel free to submit a pull request.

If you would like to see further developments, feel free to open an issue, although this
is mostly a side project I made for didactic and curiosity purposes and I don't see it
growing more than it is now. But, who knows, I can always be inspired.

If you found this project useful to explore some concepts yourself or with your students,
feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://paypal.me/sunyatasattva).
### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
